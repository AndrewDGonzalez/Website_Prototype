        <p>
            My name is Anderew Gonzalez, born and raised in sunny Oceanside California. Since a young age I've been enamored by other people's creations. I love to see art works that people have created, to see the imagination and creativity of the human mind. Everything from digital art, traditional art, 2D and 3D animation, and video games. I love seeing what people can make. My goal in life, it feels, has been to create my own arts that I feel stand among those greats. Video games have been the standouts amongst those art forms. I see games as artforms, animated worlds made real by the efforts of so many people. For as long as I can remember, I've been playing video games and for almost as long I've wanted to play a part in making them. My dream is to create and bring imagination to life. Through 3D modeling and traditional arts, I've started to do just that.
