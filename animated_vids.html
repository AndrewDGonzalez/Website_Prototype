            <h2> MechWarrior/Fury Parody</h2>
            <p>
            The following animation is one I had a lot of fun making because of the new tools I was learning and the conents.
            I love the Mech Warrior franchise. Massive walking tanks has always been a fantasy of mine and MechWarrior really checks all the boxes for me.
            When I was given the task of using Adobe Animate to make a short animation, one of the first ideas that came to mind was to further the comparison
            of mechs being walking tanks and play it off a top movie of mine. The tank-centric World War 2 movie Fury was the perfect setting. I recreated a portion
            of the amazing scene where the name movie's main cast is attacked. Using the paper-doll animation style, I worked excitedly to make something I loved. as
            first 2D animated projects went, I was very happy with it. I hope you can enjoy the following animation.

            <h2>Minecraft Lake House</h2>
            <p>
            This animation was made entrierly in Blender with the help of the MineWays program. As a kid, I loved the craze of Minecraft based animated
            videos. The style and the way the characters would move always made me excited and curious. The best of them made these blocky characters emote
            in creative ways that made me think they really were the game's characters come to life. I wanted to be apart of that so I decided to try my hand.
            This was one of my first big animations that I made on my own using guidelines from the very creators I watched.
